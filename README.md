# NetherStarMC Font Collection
With the mild disappointment that the other two font packs I made were total failures, I figured, "third time's the charm"!

Here, you can find fonts from multiple different foundries (e.g., ITC, Typodermic, etc.), which, if I play my cards right, should save you the hassle of having to search for them online. Remember: all fonts you see here are property of their original owners. One more thing: I've released this font pack under the Unlicense license, so it's available under the public domain. Whatever it is you wish to do with it...the answer will be yes.

## But what foundries are there?
Funny you should ask. Here's a list of them:
- ITC
- Bitstream (yes, I misspelled it as Bitsream (┬┬﹏┬┬))
- Font Bureau
- Berthold
- Microsoft
- Letraset
- Elsner+Flake
- URW Type Foundry
- Adobe
- Linotype
- Monotype
  
...among others. This list may or may not be accurate.
